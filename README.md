# OrlandoNeighborhoodProject
A project where I use KMeans to cluster 85 of Orlando's neighborhoods based on venue types in the vicinity of each.

This project was done for a friend so the report is not as technical as normal. It is very data-focused and the 
explanation of the Methodology is super basic.

I used BeautifulSoup for the webscraping, Geopy.Nominatim for the geographical coordinates, Folium for the maps, Foursquare
for the venues, and Pandas for just about everything else.
